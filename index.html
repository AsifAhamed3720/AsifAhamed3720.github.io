    <h3>From Normals to Mesh: High-Fidelity Vascular Surface Reconstruction</h3>
    <p>
         Undergraduate Final Year Dissertation | Computer Vision & 3D Geometry
        
        Designed and implemented a research-grade 3D reconstruction pipeline for generating accurate, watertight vascular meshes from medical CT segmentations. The project evaluated how surface normal estimation and orientation strategies influence reconstruction quality using Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction.
        
        🔹 What makes this project exceptional
        
        Designed and compared 2 complete reconstruction pipelines under identical conditions
        
        Processed multiple full-resolution CT volumes with expert-validated segmentations
        
        Achieved sub-voxel surface accuracy, quantified using standard geometric error metrics
        
        🔹 Technical Highlights
        
        Converted segmented CT volumes into adaptive point clouds containing tens of thousands of points for thin vascular structures
        
        Implemented and compared:
        
        Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + Signed Distance Function (SDF) normal orientation
        
        Geodesic Principal Component Analysis (PCA) + Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) global orientation
        
        Integrated Screened Poisson Surface Reconstruction to produce watertight meshes
        
        Evaluated reconstruction quality using RMS error, Chamfer distance, and Hausdorff distance across multiple parameter settings
        
        Conducted quantitative comparisons across several reconstruction resolutions and normal neighborhood sizes
        
        🔹 Outcome (Quantitative Impact)
        
        Demonstrated consistent reductions in surface error when using globally oriented normals
        
        Identified optimal parameter ranges that improved mesh stability and accuracy
        
        Produced vascular meshes with measured accuracy below the voxel resolution of the input CT data</p>
    <h3>Balance Buddy – Budget Management Android Application</h3>
      <p>
          Balance Buddy is a lightweight Android budget management application designed to help users track expenses, manage subscriptions, and gain meaningful financial insights. The app focuses on accessibility and performance, making it suitable for users in regions with limited access to modern banking integrations.
          
          The application is built using Kotlin and follows the MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clean separation of concerns between UI, business logic, and data handling for better scalability and maintainability.
          
          Key Features
          
          Dashboard Overview: Central hub displaying expense summaries, budget status, recent transactions, and quick navigation
          
          Expense Tracking: Categorized expense logging with monthly filtering and swipe-to-delete functionality
          
          Subscription Management: Track recurring subscriptions with automated expiry reminder notifications
          
          Income Tracking: Record and manage monthly income entries
          
          Budgeting Insights: Spending recommendations and interactive 7-day expense visualizations
          
          Bill Split: Split shared expenses equally and add them directly to personal expense records
          
          Settings & Account Management: Notification controls, profile updates, secure logout, and full account/data deletion
          
          Technology & Architecture
          
          Programming Language: Kotlin
          
          Architecture: MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)
          
          Platform: Android (API 30+)
